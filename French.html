            <div class="method">
                <p><span class="num">1.</span>For the pastry, rub the butter into the flour, sugar and a pinch of salt in a bowl until crumbly. Mix in the egg until it forms a dough, then form into a puck shape. Cover and chill for at least 30 mins. Will keep chilled for two days.</p>
                <p><span class="num">2.</span>Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/ gas 6. Roll the pastry out on a lightly floured surface to roughly the thickness of a £1 coin, and use to line a 23cm fluted tart tin, leaving some overhanging. Line with a disc of baking parchment big enough to cover the edges, and fill with some baking beans to weigh it down (use dried rice or lentils if you don’t have baking beans). Bake for 15 mins, then remove the parchment and beans and bake for 10-15 mins more until the pastry is biscuity. Trim away any overhanging pastry with a serrated knife. Set aside to cool.</p>
                <p><span class="num">3.</span>Meanwhile, set aside four of the apples, then peel, core and roughly chop the rest. Put them in a shallow saucepan with 2 tbsp water, all but 1 tbsp of the sugar and the alcohol, if using. Cover and cook over a low heat for 25-30 mins, stirring occasionally and adding more water if needed, until the apples have collapsed into a purée. Taste the mixture and sweeten with more sugar, if needed.</p>
                <p><span class="num">4.</span>Turn the oven up to 210C/190C fan/gas 8. Peel, core and halve the reserved apples, then cut into even-sized slices. Spread the apple purée over the base of the tart case, then arrange the apple slices in neat, concentric circles, starting from the outside. Brush the apples with butter, then scatter over the reserved sugar and bake for another 20-25 mins until golden.</p>    
                <p><span class="num">5.</span>Mix the jam with 1 tbsp hot water from a freshly boiled kettle. When the tart has finished baking, glaze generously with the jam, then leave to cool a little. Serve warm or cold, dusted with icing sugar, if you like.</p>

            <h3>Method</h3>
            <div class="method">
                <p><span class="num">1.</span> Whisk the eggs, coconut milk and vanilla together in a wide, shallow bowl. Dunk the brioche slices into the mixture, letting each sit in the bowl for 1-2 mins on each side to soak up the liquid. The mixture should be completely absorbed by the brioche before cooking.</p>
                <p><span class="num">2.</span> Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. To prepare the pineapple, cut away the skin, leaves and any eyes, then slice the flesh into long, chunky pieces (you’ll need about three per person). Cut out the tough core and discard. Place the pineapple pieces in a small baking dish, drizzle over the maple syrup and sprinkle with allspice. Roast for 15 mins, turning halfway through and brushing with the sticky syrup in the dish.</p>
                <p><span class="num">3.</span>Meanwhile, melt the butter in a frying pan over a low-medium heat until foaming. Scatter the desiccated coconut over a plate, and dip in each side of the soaked brioche slices to coat. (The bread will be very delicate, so do this carefully.) Cook the brioche slices for 3-4 mins on each side until golden and cooked through. Divide between two plates, then top each with a dollop of yogurt, three of the roasted pineapple pieces, then drizzle over any juices from the roasting tin.</p>

                    <li>500g strong white bread flour, plus extra for dusting</li>
                    <li>70g caster sugar</li>
                    <li>7g sachet fast-action dried yeast</li>

            <h3>Method</h3>
            <div class="method">
                <p><span class="num">1.</span>Combine the yeast, a pinch of the sugar and a couple tablespoons of lukewarm water in a small bowl. Stir to dissolve the yeast, then leave for 10 mins until foamy.</p>
                <p><span class="num">2.</span>Meanwhile, combine the flour, the remaining sugar and 3 tsp fine salt in a large bowl. Make a well in the centre, then add half the beaten egg, the yeast mixture and the oil. Pour in 200ml lukewarm water (it should feel slightly warm to the touch) and stir with a spoon, then mix using one hand, keeping the other clean while you bring the dough together. If there are a lot of very dry bits, gradually add a little water to just bring it together – you don't want it to get too wet and sticky. The dough should be moist, but not soggy.</p>
                <p><span class="num">3.</span>Once the dough has come together, turn it out onto a lightly floured surface. Knead using both hands for 10 mins until smooth and a bit springy. If it gets very sticky, add a very small amount of flour – as little as possible. A dough scraper is useful if the dough is sticking to the work surface. Stretch the sides of the dough down and pull together to form a ball. Lightly oil a bowl, then lightly roll the dough ball around the bowl so it's coated in the oil. Cover with a clean tea towel and leave in a warm place for 1 hr, or until dough has doubled in size.</p>
                <p><span class="num">4.</span>Line a baking sheet with baking parchment. Turn the dough out onto a clean work surface and divide into three equal pieces, weighing for accuracy, if you like. Roll each piece into a long sausage shape about 25cm long, tapering them slightly at both ends. Lay the pieces out in front of you, parallel to one another with a couple centimetres between each. Bring the sausages together at the top end, then plait them down the length, tucking in the ends when you reach the bottom. Carefully transfer the loaf to the prepared baking sheet and loosely cover with a clean tea towel. Leave to rise until puffy and billowy, about 40 mins.</p>
                <p><span class="num">5.</span>Meanwhile, heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6. Gently brush the rest of the beaten egg all over the challah, getting it into all the crevices, and sprinkle with the poppy or sesame seeds, if using. Bake on a middle shelf of the oven for 25-30 mins, until the loaf is golden brown underneath and sounds hollow when tapped. Check after about 15 mins – if the top of the loaf has started to get too dark, cover it with foil. Leave to cool on a wire rack, then serve.</p>
